# Artificial-Intelligence-Project
# Problem Statement
The game is categorized as a zero-sum game. Therefore, the minimax algorithm, which is a decision rule used in AI, can be applied. The project goal is to investigate how a decision tree is applied using the minimax algorithm in this game by Artificial Intelligence.
# AI in Connect Four â€” Implementing Minimax
Below is a python snippet of Minimax algorithm implementation in Connect Four. In the code, we extend the original Minimax algorithm by adding the Alpha-beta pruning strategy to improve the computational speed and save memory. The figure below is a pseudocode for the alpha-beta minimax algorithm.
