# Artificial-Intelligence-Project
# Problem Statement
The game is categorized as a zero-sum game. Therefore, the minimax algorithm, which is a decision rule used in AI, can be applied. The project goal is to investigate how a decision tree is applied using the minimax algorithm in this game by Artificial Intelligence.
# AI in Four consecutive key in grid’s cell — Implementing Minimax
Below is a python snippet of Minimax algorithm implementation in Four consecutive key in grid’s cell. In the code, we extend the original Minimax algorithm by adding the Alpha-beta pruning strategy to improve the computational speed and save memory. The figure below is a pseudocode for the alpha-beta minimax algorithm.

# Conclusions
Looking at how many times AI has beaten human players in this game, I realized that it wins by rationality and loads of information. In this project, the AI player uses a minimax algorithm to check for optimal moves in advance to outperform human players by knowing all possible moves rationally. Interestingly, when tuning the number of depths at the minimax function from high to low , the AI player may perform worse. Nevertheless, the strategy and algorithm applied in this project have been proved to be working and performing amazing results.
